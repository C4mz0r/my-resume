<p>
	Hello!
</p>
<p>
	I am a passionate software professional, skilled in improving software quality and processes.
	I enjoy figuring out how to improve efficiency and reduce costly errors.
</p>
<p>
	About a year ago, I started learning Ruby on Rails and I really enjoyed working with it.
	I was amazed at how quickly a person could build a functional application.
</p>	

<p>
	I am currently seeking employment, and looking to offer my services in a technical role where I can learn, grow, and provide high quality deliverables.
